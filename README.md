## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites

1. Install `Node.js`. This allows you to run JavaScript on your computer (outside of a browser).
   This is best done with a version manager that allows you to easily switch between
   Node.js versions based on the requirements of different projects.
   Try using any of the following.

   - [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - Node-Version-Manager.
   - [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) - Fast-Node-Manager.
   - [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

   If none of those work for any reason, you can defer to your Operating System's
   package manager or [the downloads from the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
   We will be using the latest LTS version, 20.10.0, lts/iron.

2. Install `pnpm`. This is our package manager of choice for this project.
   It's responsible for installing, uninstalling, and keeping track of the app's dependencies.
   `npm install --global pnpm`

3. Make sure to have `docker` installed, which can be installed from [the official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/). It will allow you to
   - run the local postgres database required for backend functions.
   - run backend tests that rely on Testcontainers.

### Developing

1. Clone the PeterPlate repository from GitHub.
   `git clone https://github.com/icssc/PeterPlate.git`

2. Navigate to the root directory and change your node version to the one specified in the .nvmrc by running 
   `nvm use` or `fnm use`. In particular, we will be using Node v20.
   
3. While still in the root directory and install the dependencies by running
   `cd PeterPlate && pnpm install`

4. To start a local Postgres container database run the `docker compose up` in the root directory.
   This will automatically set up and run a test database using docker.

5. Create a new file called `.env` based on the example given in `.env.development`

6. Run `pnpm db:push` to push the schema to the docker database.

7. Start local development by running `pnpm dev` in the root directory. This will start the server in `apps/server` and the client in `apps/next`.
   The tRPC procedures are available on <http://localhost:3000/><router.procedure\>?input={field: value}

   ```sh
   # example
   http://localhost:3000/events.get
   ```

8.  Pull the latest CampusDish data into your local database by `cd`'ing into the `apps/server` directory and running `pnpm run test:daily` or `pnpm run test:weekly`.

9.  View the local website at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). As you make changes to the Next.js application, those changes will be automatically
reflected on the local website.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes, you may run into errors when trying to run some of the commands listed above. Here are some things that can help fix this:

Reinstall packages
- Run `rm -force node_modules` and `pnpm install` to reinstall all packages in the project

Ensure Node is correct version
- Node v20 (latest of that version)
- Check by running `node -v`
- If not, download/switch to v20, by running:
   - `fnm install v20` or `nvm install v20`
   - `fnm use 20` or `nvm use 20`

### Testing

Run `npx turbo test` at the root of the project.

**Database**

Run the following commands to pull data into your local database. 

```sh
cd apps/server

# For daily test
pnpm test:daily

# For weekly test
pnpm test:weekly
```

If you want to check the contents of the database, run the following command in the root directory (while the server is not running).

```sh
pnpm db:studio
```

### Adding Workspaces

To add a new package run `turbo gen workspace` and follow the prompts.
