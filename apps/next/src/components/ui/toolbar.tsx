 * - A clickable application logo (`Image`) wrapped in a `Link` that navigates to the homepage ("/").
 * - A `DatePicker` component to allow users to select a specific date. The selected date
 *   is managed via the `useDate` context.
 * - A `SheetTrigger` (styled as a `Button` with an icon) to open a `Sheet`
 *   which contains the `SidebarContent`.
 *
 * It leverages the `useDate` custom hook to access and update the globally selected date.
 * @returns {JSX.Element} The rendered toolbar component.

   * - If the `newDateFromPicker` is the current calendar day ("today"),
   *   `selectedDate` is set to the current date *and time* (i.e., `new Date()`).
   *   This ensures that any application logic relying on the current time of day
   *   (e.g., determining if a dining hall is currently open) operates correctly.
   * - If `newDateFromPicker` is a day other than today (past or future),
   *   `selectedDate` is set to `newDateFromPicker` directly. Typically, date pickers
   *   return a date set to the beginning of the day (00:00:00), which is suitable
   *   for viewing schedules or data for an entire specific day.
   * - If `newDateFromPicker` is `undefined` (e.g., the date selection was cleared),
   *   `selectedDate` is set to `undefined`.
   *
   * @param {Date | undefined} newDateFromPicker - The date selected by the user in the
   *   `DatePicker`, or `undefined` if the selection was cleared.
