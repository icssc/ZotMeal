x`### Pre-requisites

1. Install `Node.js`. This allows you to run JavaScript on your computer (outside of a browser).
   This is best done with a version manager that allows you to easily switch between
   Node.js versions based on the requirements of different projects.
   Try using any of the following.

   - [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) - Node-Version-Manager.
   - [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) - Fast-Node-Manager.
   - [nvm-widows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) - For Windows machines

   If none of those work for any reason, you can defer to your Operating System's
   package manager or [the downloads from the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
   We will be using the latest LTS version of Node.

2. Install `pnpm`. This is our package manager of choice for this project.
   It's responsible for installing, uninstalling, and keeping track of the app's dependencies.
   `npm install --global pnpm`

3. Make sure to have `docker` installed, which can be installed from [the official website](https://www.docker.com/get-started/). It will allow you to
   - run the local postgres database required for backend functions.
   - run backend tests that rely on Testcontainers.

### Developing

1. Clone the ZotMeal repository or your fork.
   `git clone https://github.com/icssc/ZotMeal.git`

3. Change your node version to the one specified in the .nvmrc
   `nvm use` or `fnm use`
   
5. Navigate to the root directory and install the dependencies.
   `cd ZotMeal && pnpm install`

6. To start a local Postgres container database run the `docker compose up` in the root directory.
   This will automatically set up and run a test database using docker.

7. Create a .env based on the example given in `.env.development`

8. Run `pnpm db:push` to push the schema to the docker database.

9. Start local development by running `pnpm dev` in the root directory. `/apps/expo` and `pnpm dev` in `/apps/server` (or `pnpm dev` in the root directory).
   The tRPC procedures are available on <http://localhost:3000/><router.procedure\>?input={field: value}

```sh
   # example
   http://localhost:3000/events.get
```

10. View the local website at <http://localhost:8081> and/or with the [Expo Go mobile app](https://expo.dev/client).
   As you make changes to the Expo application, those changes will be automatically
   reflected on the local website as well as the mobile app.

### Troubleshooting

Sometimes, you may run into errors when trying to run some of the commands listed above. Here are some things that can help fix this:

Reinstall packages
- Run `rm -force node_modules` and `pnpm install` to reinstall all packages in the project

Ensure Node is correct version
- Node v20 (latest of that version)
- Check by running `node -v`

Clear expo cache
- Run `npx expo start -c` to clear the expo cache. This usually helps when `pnpm dev` gives an expo related error 
### Structure Overview

The following directory tree outlines the major folders in the ZotMeal repository:

```
ðŸ“¦ZotMeal
 â”£ ðŸ“‚node_modules
 â”£ ðŸ“‚apps
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚expo
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚server
 â”£ ðŸ“‚packages
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚api
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚db
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚validators
 â”£ ðŸ“œpackage.json
 ...
```

The `node_modules` folder contains all ***Node.js*** packages that the repository uses

The `apps` folder contains major endpoints that ZotMeal uses
- `apps/expo` contains all the frontend scripts used to build the mobile app, written in **React Native**.
- `apps/server` contains the scripts used to connect backend functions to AWS Lambda Serverless procedures.

The `packages` folder contains all the functionality of the backend of ZotMeal.
- `packages/api` contains all the ***tRPC** procedures used
- `packages/db` contains the database schema (written using ***DrizzleORM***)
- `packages/validators` contains information used for type verification of API schemas used in the backend (written using ***Zod***)

### Testing

Run `turbo test` at the root of the project.

### Adding Workspaces

To add a new package run `turbo gen workspace` and follow the prompts
