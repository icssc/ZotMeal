Taking a look inside the `./packages/api/src` folder we find something like this:

```
ðŸ“‚packages/src  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚dishes  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚events  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚menus    
 â”£ ðŸ“‚periods  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ratings  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚restaurants  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚stations
 â”£ ðŸ“‚users
 ...
```

Each folder corresponds to a set of tRPC procedures that handles one major feature.

Within each subfolder, we find 2-4 `.ts` files that looks something like this:

```
ðŸ“‚dishes  
 â”£ ðŸ“œrouter.test.ts  
 â”£ ðŸ“œrouter.ts  
 â”£ ðŸ“œservices.test.ts  
 â”— ðŸ“œservices.ts
```

- The `router.ts` file contains tRPC procedures that exported via the tRPC router.
- The `services.ts` file contains helper functions that are used in the tRPC procedures mentioned above
- The files with extension `.test.ts` contain tests that run when running `turbo test`. See ***creating tests*** for more information.
- For our tRPC functions, we use Zod to define and validate schemas for input variables at runtime.

We will now go into detail about each individual tRPC procedure.
