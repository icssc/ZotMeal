# The Nextjs Frontend

The other half of ZotMeal's frontend -- written in the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) framework.

    b. [ðŸ“‚ Components](#-components)
    c. [ðŸ“‚ Lib](#-lib)
3. [Backend Integration](#backend-integration)

# App Structure

The web app is contained in apps/next, which should look something like:

```
ðŸ“¦apps/next
 â”£ ðŸ“‚.next
 â”£ ðŸ“‚node_modules
 â”£ ðŸ“‚public
 â”£ ðŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚app
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚components
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚lib
 â”ƒ ...
 ...
```

We will now go into detail about each subdirectory of `ðŸ“‚src`, where most of the work is done.

## ðŸ“‚ App
In `ðŸ“‚app`, we use Next.js file router to establish **pages**, which are web pages rendered individually from one another, each with a unique URL.

```
ðŸ“‚app
 â”£ ðŸ“‚about
 â”£ ðŸ“‚events
 â”£ favicon.ico
 â”£ globals.css
 â”£ layout.tsx
 â”£ page.tsx
```

Without going too far into the weeds of the [Next.js page router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts), let's breakdown each element:

- `ðŸ“‚about` & `ðŸ“‚events`: Each folder in Next (if containing a `page.tsx`) represents a page. In this case, `/about` and `/events`.
- `favicon.ico`: The favicon of the website (the little image that appears next to the tab name).
- `globals.css`: The global stylesheet for all pages, used by tailwindcss.
- `page.tsx`: The homepage for the web app.

## ðŸ“‚ Components

All of the Next components used in ZotMeal's Nextjs web app are defined in `ðŸ“‚components`.

ZotMeal extends a lot of the [shad/cn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library's components. As such, you may be better off looking at their documentation to implement your own component for ZotMeal.

See [Components](#components) for more details on each unique component.

## ðŸ“‚ Lib

`ðŸ“‚lib` is largely empty (as of `v0.1 preview`), but there are plans to implement the backend integration functions (such as fetching with tRPC) in this folder.
