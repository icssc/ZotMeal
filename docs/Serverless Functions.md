## Cron Jobs

Inside the `./apps/server` you will something like this

```
ðŸ“¦apps/server  
 â”£ ðŸ“‚node_modules
 â”£ ðŸ“‚src/functions
 â”ƒ   â”£ ðŸ“‚cron
 â”ƒ   â”— ðŸ“‚trpc    
 ...
```

The `src/functions/trpc` directory is used for creating API endpoints for our tRPC functions (for future work)

Inside the `src/functions/cron` we can find:

```
ðŸ“‚cron  
 â”£ ðŸ“œbroadcastNotification.ts  
 â”£ ðŸ“œdaily.ts    
 â”— ðŸ“œweekly.ts
```

Each of these `.ts` functions corresponds to a specific ****cron**** job that our app performs.

- **Daily**: Fetches the menu from CampusDishAPI for the current day and inserts it into the database. Runs every day at midnight to ensure the most up to date menu information.

- **Weekly**: Fetches all menus from CampusDishAPI for all days at most 2 week away from today. Allows users to see future menus for up to 2 week away.

- **BroadcastNotification**: Broadcasts a notification using expo notifications when special events are occurring on the given day.
